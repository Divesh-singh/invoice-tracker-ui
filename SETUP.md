# Next.js Setup (local)

This repository was scaffolded with a minimal Next.js App Router setup.

PowerShell commands (run in project root `c:\Users\PC\Desktop\Gumbotech\invoice-tracker-ui`):

```powershell
# 1) Install dependencies
npm install

# 2) Start development server
npm run dev

# 3) Build for production
npm run build

# 4) Run production build locally
npm run start
```

Notes:
- The project uses the App Router (`/app` directory).
- Replace `next`, `react`, and `react-dom` versions in `package.json` if you need pinned versions.
- Add assets to the `public/` folder.
